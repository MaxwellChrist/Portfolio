This project is going to be the process of creating my first portfolio website! I've never created one before and I recently bought a domain name I like, so I wanted to create something to show off. I'm most comfortable using react as a framework, so I will be building it using create-react-app and solely implementing front end features. There's a few libraries I've come across that I would like to implement into the project, such as emailjs and greensock, but I'm sure I'll be adding more as I progress with this project. Wish me luck and once I have my contact page setup, I'll have it hooked to emailjs so if you'd like to leave me a message, you will be able to do so there. Wish me luck and I hope you enjoy the final project.
